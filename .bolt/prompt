For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, modern, professional and responsive, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

In the code you produce, include clear and detailed comments that explain how different sections of code work. Also use comments to mark different sections of the code.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.
